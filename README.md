# Sand Box Type-O : A Portfolio

 There are going to be a couple of dramatic revisions in the next twenty updates.  
Nonetheless, this small website is designed to serve as a 'playground' for ideas or concepts that I want to see come into fruition.

## Updates

#### 02/17/2022
As of right now, This webpage is a small portion of what Type-O has to showcase, which at the moment, isn't much. This will, as I have previously stated, serve as a sand box to experiment with different technologies.  
`boxes.html` and `tables.html` are placeholder titles for other technologies that I'll hope to implement (boxes will serve as a page dedicated to ai, tables is still in the air) within the website in the next couple of months.
